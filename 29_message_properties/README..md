# 29 - Routes and EndPoints - Message Properties #

We're now going to add some properties to our messages to trigger the new Route.

- Back in PuTTY, make sure that your session is still active.
- Make sure your code isn’t still running – Press “ctrl+c” to stop it if it is.
- Type “git checkout 11_add_routes” and press enter.
- The terminal should say “Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/11_add_routes'.”
- Type “chmod 777 readcriticalqueue.js” to make sure you can edit the readcriticalqueue.js file.
- Type “sudo node index.js” and press the Enter key to run the code.
- Wait for the terminal to show “Client Connected”.
